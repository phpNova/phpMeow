phpMeow - Versioning Guidelines
--------------------------------

1. phpMeow is officially maintained on Github at http://www.github.com/sirkris/phpmeow.  
This is the repository from which version incrementation will be determined as per these guidelines.

2. The FIRST release commit to the master branch (major release) shall be 1.00.  Prior to that, 
version was 0.00.

3. Each subsequent release commit to the master branch shall increment the version by +0.1.

4. Each HOTFIX commit to master shall increment the version by +0.01.  However, when the next 
release commit hits master, the hundredths digit will be reset to 0.  If that digit exceeds 
9, use hexidecimal (A, B, and so-on).  If that digit exceeds F (if this ever happens, we've got 
some serious QA issues!), then a thousandths digit shall appear, beginning at 1 and incrementing 
in the same fashion.  New digits can be added indefinitely as-needed.  For example, the 57th 
hotfix to version 1.30 would make it version 1.3FFFC (Odin forbid!).  This is of course not true 
hex, but doing it this way prevents the confusion that would arise from having a difference 
between version 1.31 and 1.310.  I prefer to have every possible contingency covered.

5. Place an "a" or a "b" after the version number to denote alpha and beta stages, respectively.  
This has no effect on the numbering itself.  Once a letter is incremented, or removed entirely, 
the numbering does not in any way reset.  The stage letter can only be added/changed/removed 
on a major release.  It is in place solely to let everyone know what stage of development the 
project is currently in.  Anything in a release branch is assumed to be "beta" for that release 
candidate until it is merged into master; if the "b" is not present, it's implied.  Likewise, 
anything in develop or a feature branch is automatically considered to be "alpha."

6. For the sake of my immense ego, this versioning approach shall be known as the Craig Method.
